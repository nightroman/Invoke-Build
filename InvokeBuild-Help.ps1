### Invoke-Build.ps1
@{
	command = 'Invoke-Build.ps1'
	synopsis = 'Invoke-Build - Build Automation in PowerShell'

	description = @'
	The command invokes so called tasks defined in a PowerShell script.
	Let's call this process build and a script with tasks build script.

	A build script defines parameters, variables, and one or more tasks.
	Any code is invoked with the current location set to $BuildRoot,
	the script directory. $ErrorActionPreference is set to 'Stop'.

	SCRIPT PARAMETERS

	Build scripts define parameters as usual using the param() block.
	On calling, specify them for Invoke-Build as if they are its own.

	Known issue #4. Specify script switches after Task and File.

	The following parameter names are reserved for the engine:
	Task, File, Result, Safe, Summary, WhatIf

	COMMANDS AND HELP

	The following commands are available for build scripts:

		task      (Add-BuildTask)
		exec      (Invoke-BuildExec)
		assert    (Assert-Build)
		equals    (Assert-BuildEquals)
		property  (Get-BuildProperty)
		requires  (Test-BuildAsset)
		use       (Use-BuildAlias)
		error     (Get-BuildError)

		Get-BuildSynopsis
		Resolve-MSBuild
		Write-Build
		Write-Warning [1]

	[1] Write-Warning is redefined internally in order to count warnings in
	a build script and nested scripts. Warnings in modules are not counted.

	To get commands help, dot-source Invoke-Build and then call help:

		PS> . Invoke-Build
		PS> help task -full

	SPECIAL ALIASES

		Invoke-Build
		Build-Parallel

	These aliases are for the scripts Invoke-Build.ps1 and Build-Parallel.ps1.
	Use them for calling nested builds, i.e. omit script extensions and paths.

	PUBLIC VARIABLES

		$WhatIf    - WhatIf mode, Invoke-Build parameter
		$BuildRoot - build script location, by default
		$BuildFile - build script path
		$BuildTask - initial tasks
		$Task      - current task

	$BuildRoot may be changed by scripts on loading in order to set a custom
	build root directory. Other variables should not be changed.

	$Task is available for script blocks defined by task parameters If, Inputs,
	Outputs, and Jobs and by blocks Enter|Exit-BuildTask, Enter|Exit-BuildJob,
	Set-BuildHeader, Set-BuildFooter.

		$Task properties:

		- Name - [string], task name
		- Jobs - [object[]], task jobs
		- Started - [DateTime], task start time

		And in Exit-BuildTask:

		- Error - task error or null
		- Elapsed - [TimeSpan], task duration

	BUILD BLOCKS

	Scripts may define special script blocks. They are invoked:

		Enter-Build {} - before the first task
		Exit-Build {} - after the last task

		Enter-BuildTask {} - before each task
		Exit-BuildTask {} - after each task

		Enter-BuildJob {} - before each task action
		Exit-BuildJob {} - after each task action

		Set-BuildHeader {param($Path)} - to write task headers
		Set-BuildFooter {param($Path)} - to write task footers

	Blocks are not called on WhatIf.
	Nested builds do not inherit parent blocks.
	If Enter-X is called then Exit-X is also called, even on failures.

	Enter-Build and Exit-Build are invoked in the script scope. Enter-Build is
	suitable for initialization and it can output text unlike the build script.

	Enter-BuildTask, Exit-BuildTask, Enter-BuildJob, and Exit-BuildJob are
	invoked in the same scope, the parent of task action blocks.

	PRIVATE STUFF

	Function and variable names starting with '*' are reserved for the engine.
'@

	parameters = @{
		Task = @'
		One or more tasks to be invoked. If it is not specified, null, empty,
		or equal to '.' then the task '.' is invoked if it exists, otherwise
		the first added task is invoked.

		Names with wildcard characters are reserved for special cases.

		SAFE REFERENCES

		If a task 'X' is referenced as '?X' then it is allowed to fail without
		breaking the build, i.e. other tasks specified after X will be invoked.

		SPECIAL TASKS

		? - Tells to list tasks with brief information and check for errors.
		Task synopses are defined in preceding comments as # Synopsis: ...

		?? - Tells to collect and get all tasks as an ordered dictionary.
		It can be used by external tools for analysis, completion, etc.

		Tasks ? and ?? set $WhatIf to true. Properly designed build scripts
		should not perform anything significant if $WhatIf is set to true.

		* - Tells to invoke all tasks, for example when tasks are tests.

		** - Invokes * for all files *.test.ps1 found recursively in the
		current directory or a directory specified by the parameter File.
'@
		File = @'
		A build script which adds tasks by the command 'task' (Add-BuildTask).

		If it is not specified then Invoke-Build looks for *.build.ps1 files in
		the current location. A single file is used as the script. If there are
		more files then .build.ps1 is used if it exists, otherwise build fails.

		If the build file is not found then a script defined by the environment
		variable InvokeBuildGetFile is called with the path as an argument. For
		this location it may return the full path of a special build script.

		If the file is still not found then parent directories are searched.

		INLINE SCRIPT

		'File' is a script block which is normally used in order to assemble a
		build on the fly without creating and using an extra build script file.

		$BuildFile is the calling script (or null, e.g. in jobs).
		The default $BuildRoot is its directory (or the current location).

		Script parameters, parallel, and persistent builds are not supported.
'@
		Result = @'
		Tells to make the build result. Normally it is the name of a variable
		created in the calling scope. Or it is a hashtable which entry Value
		contains the result.

		Result properties:

			All - all available tasks
			Error - a terminating build error
			Tasks - invoked tasks including nested
			Errors - error objects including nested
			Warnings - warning objects including nested
			Redefined - list of original redefined tasks

		Tasks is a list of objects:

			Name - task name
			Jobs - task jobs
			Error - task error
			Started - start time
			Elapsed - task duration
			InvocationInfo - task location (.ScriptName, .ScriptLineNumber)

		Errors is a list of objects:

			Error - original error
			File - current $BuildFile
			Task - current $Task or null for other errors

		Warnings is a list of objects:

			Message - warning message
			File - current $BuildFile
			Task - current $Task or null for other warnings

		Do not change these data and do not use not documented members.
'@
		Safe = @'
		Tells to catch a build failure, store an error as the property Error of
		Result and return quietly. A caller should use Result and check Error.

		Some exceptions are possible even in the safe mode. They show serious
		errors, not build failures. For example, a build script is missing.

		When Safe is used together with the special task ** (invoke *.test.ps1)
		then task failures stop current test scripts, not the whole testing.
'@
		Summary = @'
		Tells to show summary information after the build. It includes task
		durations, names, locations, and error messages.
'@
		WhatIf = @'
		Tells to show tasks and jobs to be invoked and some analysis of used
		parameters and environment variables. See Show-TaskHelp for details.

		If a script does anything but adding tasks then it should check for
		$WhatIf and skip the real actions in order to support WhatIf calls.
		Alternatively, use the Enter-Build block for pre-build actions.
'@
	}

	outputs = @(
		@{
			type = 'Text'
			description = @'
		Build log which includes task records and engine messages, warnings,
		errors, and output from build script tasks and special blocks.

		The script itself should not output anything. Unexpected script output
		causes warnings, in the future it may be treated as an error.

### Add-BuildTask
@{
	command = 'Add-BuildTask'
	synopsis = '(task) Defines and adds a task.'

	description = @'
	Scripts use its alias 'task'. It is normally used in the build script scope
	but it can be called from another script or function. Build scripts should
	have at least one task.

	This command is all that build scripts really need. Tasks are main build
	blocks. Other build commands are helpers, scripts do not have to use them.

	In addition to task parameters, you may use task help comments, synopses,
	preceding task definitions:

		# Synopsis: ...
		task ...

	Synopses are used in task help information returned by the command

		Invoke-Build ?

	To get a task synopsis during a build, use Get-BuildSynopsis.
'@

	parameters = @{
		Name = @'
		The task name. Wildcard characters are deprecated and "?" must not be
		the first character. Duplicated names are allowed, each added task
		overrides previously added with the same name.
'@
		Jobs = @'
		Specifies one or more task jobs or a hashtable with actual parameters.
		Jobs are other task references and own actions, script blocks. Any
		number of jobs is allowed. Jobs are invoked in the specified order.

		Valid jobs are:

			[string] - an existing task name, normal reference
			[string] "?Name" - safe reference to a task allowed to fail
			[scriptblock] - action, a script block invoked for this task

		Special value:

			[hashtable] which contains the actual task parameters in addition
			to the task name. This task definition is more convenient with
			complex parameters, often typical for incremental tasks.

			Example:
				task Name @{
					Inputs = {...}
					Outputs = {...}
					Partial = $true
					Jobs = {
						process {...}
					}
				}
'@
		After = @'
		Tells to add this task to the end of jobs of the specified tasks.

		Altered tasks are defined as normal references (TaskName) or safe
		references (?TaskName). In the latter case this inserted task may
		fail without stopping a build.

		Parameters After and Before are used in order to alter task jobs
		in special cases when direct changes in task source code are not
		suitable. Use Jobs in order to define relations in usual cases.
'@
		Before = @'
		Tells to insert this task to jobs of the specified tasks.
		It is inserted before the first action or added to the end.

		See After for details.
'@
		If = @{default = '$true'; description = @'
		Specifies the optional condition to be evaluated. If the condition
		evaluates to false then the task is not invoked. The condition is
		defined in one of two ways depending on the requirements.

		Using standard Boolean notation (parenthesis) the condition is checked
		once when the task is defined. A use case for this notation might be
		evaluating a script parameter or another sort of global condition.

			Example:
				task Task1 -If ($Param1 -eq ...) {...}
				task Task2 -If ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 5) {...}

		Using script block notation (curly braces) the condition is evaluated
		on task invocation. If a task is referenced by several tasks then the
		condition is evaluated each time until it gets true and the task is
		invoked. The script block notation is normally used for a condition
		that may be defined or changed during the build or just expensive.

			Example:
				task SomeTask -If {...} {...}
'@}
		Inputs = @'
		Specifies the input items, tells to process the task as incremental,
		and requires the parameter Outputs with the optional switch Partial.

		Inputs are file items or paths or a script block which gets them.

		Outputs are file paths or a script block which gets them.
		A script block is invoked with input paths piped to it.

		Automatic variables for incremental task actions:

			$Inputs - full input paths, array of strings
			$Outputs - result of the evaluated Outputs

		With the switch Partial the task is processed as partial incremental.
		There must be one-to-one correspondence between Inputs and Outputs.

		Partial task actions often contain "process {}" blocks.
		Two more automatic variables are available for them:

			$_ - full path of an input item
			$2 - corresponding output path

		See also wiki topics about incremental tasks:
		https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build/wiki
'@
		Outputs = @'
		Specifies the output paths of the incremental task, either directly on
		task creation or as a script block invoked with the task. It is used
		together with Inputs. See Inputs for details.
'@
		Partial = @'
		Tells to process the incremental task as partial incremental.
		It is used with Inputs and Outputs. See Inputs for details.
'@
		Data = @'
		Any object attached to the task. It is not used by the engine.
		When the task is invoked this object is available as $Task.Data.
'@
		Done = @'
		Specifies the command or a script block which is invoked after the
		task. Custom handlers should check for $Task.Error if it matters.
'@
		Source = @'
		Specifies the task source. It is used by wrapper functions in order to
		provide the actual source for location messages and synopsis comments.

### Use-BuildAlias
@{
	command = 'Use-BuildAlias'
	synopsis = '(use) Sets framework or directory tool aliases.'

	description = @'
	Scripts use its alias 'use'. Invoke-Build does not change the system path
	in order to make framework tools available by names. This is not suitable
	for using mixed framework tools (in different tasks, scripts, parallel
	builds). Instead, this function is used for setting tool aliases in the
	scope where it is called.

	This command may be used in the script scope to make aliases for all tasks.
	But it can be called from tasks in order to use more task specific tools.
'@

	parameters = @{
		Path = @'
		Specifies the tools directory.

		If it is * or it starts with digits followed by a dot then the MSBuild
		path is resolved using the package script Resolve-MSBuild.ps1. Build
		scripts may invoke it directly by the provided alias Resolve-MSBuild.
		The optional suffix x86 tells to use 32-bit MSBuild.

		If it is like Framework* then it is assumed to be a path relative to
		Microsoft.NET in the Windows directory.

		Otherwise it is a full or relative literal path of any directory.

		Examples: *, 4.0, Framework\v4.0.30319, .\Tools
'@
		Name = @'
		Specifies the tool names. They become aliases in the current scope.
		If it is a build script then the aliases are created for all tasks.
		If it is a task then the aliases are available just for this task.
'@

### Write-Build
@{
	command = 'Write-Build'
	synopsis = 'Writes text using colors if they are supported.'

	description = @'
	This function is used in order to output colored text, e.g. to a console.
	Unlike Write-Host it is suitable for redirected output, e.g. to a file.
	If the current host does not support colors then just text is written.
'@

	parameters = @{

		Any number of builds is allowed, including 0 and 1. The maximum number
		of parallel builds is the number of processors by default. It can be
		changed by the parameter MaximumBuilds.
'@
		Result = @'
		Tells to output build results using a variable. It is either a name of
		variable to be created for results or any object with the property
		Value to be assigned ([ref], [hashtable]).

		Result properties:

			Tasks - tasks (*)
			Errors - errors (*)
			Warnings - warnings (*)
			Started - start time
			Elapsed - build duration

		(*) see: help Invoke-Build -Parameter Result

### Build-Checkpoint.ps1
@{
	command = 'Build-Checkpoint.ps1'
	synopsis = 'Invokes persistent builds with checkpoints.'
	description = @'
	This command invokes the build specified by the hashtable Build so that it
	writes checkpoints to the file specified by Checkpoint. If the build fails
	then it may be resumed later, use the switch Resume in addition to the
	original Checkpoint parameter. The build is resumed at the failed task.

	Not every build may be persistent, right away or at all:

		- Think carefully of what the persistent build state is.
		- Some data are not suitable for persistence in clixml files.
		- Changes in stopped build scripts may cause incorrect resuming.
		- Checkpoint files must not be used with different engine versions.

	CUSTOM EXPORT AND IMPORT

	By default, the command saves and restores build tasks, script path, and
	all parameters declared by the build script, not just specified by Build.
	Tip: consider to declare some script variables as artificial parameters
	in order to make them persistent.

	If this is not enough for saving and restoring the build state then use
	custom export and import blocks. The export block is called on writing
	checkpoints, i.e. on each task. The import block is called on resuming
	once, before the task to be resumed.

	The export block is defined as

		Set-BuildData Checkpoint.Export {
			$script:var1
			$script:var2
		}

	The import block is defined as

		Set-BuildData Checkpoint.Import {
			param($data)
			$var1, $var2 = $data
		}

	Note that the import block is called in the script scope. In the example,
	variables $var1, $var2 are the script variables, you may but do not have
	to use the prefix `$script:`. The parameter $data is the data written by
	Checkpoint.Export, exported to clixml and then imported from clixml.
'@

		Specifies the checkpoint file (clixml). The checkpoint file is removed
		after successful builds. If a build fails and it is not going to be
		resumed then delete the checkpoint file manually.
'@
		Build = @'
		Specifies the build and script parameters. WhatIf is not supported.
		On Resume tasks, script path, and script parameters are ignored.
'@
